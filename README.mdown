Using Drools with JPF
=====================
This project has a simple example of using Drools as a listener with JPF. It includes both Java and Scala examples. As JPF is not in Maven, there are some hard-coded dependencies in the POM that you will want to remove.

I run this by using:

    mvn clean compile exec:java exec:exec -Dexec.mainClass=com.cflewis.jpfools.ScalaRunner -Dexec.executable=java -Dexec.args="-jar [path to JPF JAR] [path to Runner.jpf]
